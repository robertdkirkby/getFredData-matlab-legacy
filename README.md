# getFredData-matlab-legacy
getFredData, as it existed until April 2024 (when it switched from datenum to datetime for matlab dates)

R2022 of Matlab changed the way to handle dates from 'datenum' to 'datetime'. In April 2024 getFredData() got a breaking update to switch from datenum to datetime. This repository hosts a legacy copy of getFredData() as it was at the beginning of April 2024 (so using datenum), it exists just so you can run older codes.

The current version of matlab can be found here: https://github.com/robertdkirkby/getfreddata-matlab
